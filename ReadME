# Hello, I'm Thulasi Priya

I’m a final year student, currently focused on doing everything I *should have* done as a sophomore but making progress nonetheless.

## Things I'm Good At (or I like to believe so)
- Reading code like a language I’m becoming fluent in  
- Using AI until it gives up on me (then turning to Reddit, Stack Overflow, and Discord)  
- Automating tasks I prefer not to do manually...which is most of them

## Projects I'm Working On

- **Dex WorkflowVerse**  
  An experimental decentralized workflow automation platform that aims to modularize microservices as verifiable units. Think puzzle pieces you can buy, sell, or rent for flexible serverless workflows.  
  *If you have any ideas or suggestions, I’d be very happy to hear them!*

- **Replication as a Service**  
  Exploring scalable data replication solutions as a service offering. This is still early-stage and hasn’t reached GitHub-commit-worthy progress yet, but it’s on my radar!

## Tech stack & tools 

`React (TypeScript)` • `Node.js` • `Express.js` • `PostgreSQL (Supabase)` • `Docker` • `Vite` • `Zustand` • `Shamir's Secret Sharing` • `GitHub Actions` • `Vercel` • `Netlify`

## Recent Experience Highlights

- Contributed advanced backend bug fixes and API enhancements in open-source projects through Social Summer of Code (SSoC)  

## Personal Motto
> "Commit often. Break things responsibly. Blame semicolons."
